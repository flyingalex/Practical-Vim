###9. Compose Repeatable Changes

>Compose your changes in such a way that they can be repeated with the dot command.

Why?Because you can use dot to repeat your change.The examples in the book, there are 3 options to delete a word(`dbx`, `bdw`, `daw`),only the last one is repeatable by dot command.You need to create more command like the last one, which will make your edition effective.
