###1.Meet the Dot Command

`.` means repeat the last change.When you do delete,move,or replace, if you want to do the last operation again, you can just press `.`.You also can use it to repeat the operation like this:Press the `i` become the INSERT MODE, do some modification, then switch the MODE to NORMAL MODE, all the operations between the two modes can use `.` to repeat.Pretty Awesome, isn't it?
