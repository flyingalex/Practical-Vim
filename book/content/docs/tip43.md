### 43. Explore the File System with netrw

`netrw` can help you manage your file system,but you need to set `set nocompatible` and `filetype plugin on` in you .vimrc file.

`:Explore` or `:E` can open the current directory,the `netrw` also provide `:Sexplore` and `:Vexplore` to open the file in a other window.

In the `netrw` mode, you can use `%` create a new file, `d` create a new directory, `R` rename the file/directory under the cursor and `D` delete the file/directory under the cursor.
